# COMM 493 FINAL ASSIGNMENT

For our final assignment in COMM 493 - Artificial Intelligence in Business, we were tasked with brainstorming a 
retail solution for a fictional fashion company and we're given various datasets. Our solution was to create a
machine learning algorithm to predict based on a users clothing preferences, what products they might be interested
in for future purchases. This was done using the products purchased within the same orders and assigning a frequency
value to which products most often appeared together. We also used an algorithm that established which shoppers had
the most similar taste in purchasing style and used this information to suggest new products to these customers based
on this shared fashion style.

## Execution

In order to execute the project, pip install the requirements.txt file and simply run the jupyter notebook.

## Usage

Within the program, the main functions are to call up a customers most recent, frequent, or a random purchase from their history.
With this product ID we can either pass it into a function to predict similar products, or use the customer id to predict what products they may like.
